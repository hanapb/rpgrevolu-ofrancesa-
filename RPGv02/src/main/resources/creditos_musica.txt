What this is,
The truest representation of Ultima Online's music (the closest you'll get to what the original composers Joe Basquez, Kirk Winterrowd intended)
An unaltered MP3 conversion directly from original MIDIs on a retail Ultima Online disc
MP3s were digitally recorded from a Roland SCC-1, the most advanced General MIDI synthesizer available at the time Ultima Online's music was composed
This is certainly the playback device preferred by the original composers
The audio detail provided by the Roland SCC-1 is comparable to going from 480p to 4K
